- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aphillip22
- 👀 I am happy when I'm busy. I love to hike, learn, read, watch, question, experience, and enjoy.
- 🌱 I’m adept with the implementation of html, css, javascript, jquery, json, node.js, and both client and server-side api's. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any new projects that will enhance my learning experience.
- 📫 I can be reached via email at amber.rain.phillips@gmail.com
